<font color=#c80000><b>Large-scale Image Tagging with Metric Learning and Matrix Completion</b></font>
<p align="left">In the last few years, image tagging problem has become an active research topic due to the urgent needs to categorize, retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. However, manually labeling is labor costing, and tags crawled from the surrounding contexts of an image are usually problematic. To address these problem, we developed a set of automatic image tagging algorithms, based on <b>Machine Learning</b> techniques. </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="degree">Matrix Completion based Large-scale Image Tag Recovery</span> <span class="alignright">2013 - present</span></li>
<p align="left">Generally, user-provided tags with images in social media are incomplete and noisy, so we propose an efficient semi-supervised algorithm to solve the problem of <b>tag completion</b> that is able to simultaneously fill out the missing tags and remove noisy tags, where the tag correlations are fully explored through a <b>matrix completion</b> component.</p>

<p align="left">Following the topic model, the tags of each image are drawn independently from a small mixture of multinomial distributions, which can be interpreted as a low rank enforcement and could be achieved through a <b>nuclear norm minimizer</b>. We show theoretically with recovery error bounds that the proposed noisy tag matrix recovery algorithm is able to simultaneously recover the missing tags and de-emphasize the noisy tags even with a limited number of observations. In addition, a graph Laplacian based component is introduced to combine the noisy matrix recovery component with visual features. The scheme of the proposed algorithm is shown by clicking <a href="images/tcmr.png">here</a>. </p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Simultaneously enrich incomplete tags and remove noisy tags. </li>
  <li>Explore the tag interactions (both between tag keywords and tags of different images) via a low rank matrix completion component. </li>
  <li>Solve a convex optimization problem and thus computationally efficient. ( Most existing topic model solve a non-convex problem) </li>
  <li>Provide theoretical guarantees, i.e., statistical error bounds</li>
  <li>Capture the visual-tag dependency by a graph Laplacian</li>
  <li>Precision and efficiency are greatly improved compared with state-of-the-art tag completion algorithms. </li>
</ul>	
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Adaptive to other image tagging tasks including image tag recommendation, tag ranking, and tag refinement.</li>
  <li>Could be easily extend to other information media like document, music and audio tagging/labeling tasks, and sentiment analysis tasks as well.</li>
  <li>Good scalability: adaptive to large datasets including NUS-WIDE(250K) and ImageNet 2014 (1.25M) in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. (Codes for large scale data will come soon! :)</li>

<li><span class="degree">Efficient Kernel Metric Learning for Large Scale Image Annotation</span> <span class="alignright">2012 - 2013</span></li>

<p align="left">One of the key challenges in search-based image annotation models is to define an appropriate similarity measure between images. Many kernel distance metric learning algorithms have been developed in order to capture the nonlinear relationships between visual features and semantics of the images. One fundamental limitation in applying kernel metric learning to image annotation problem is that it requires converting image annotations into binary constraints, leading to a significant information loss. In addition, most kernel metric learning algorithms suffer from high computational cost due to the requirement that the learned matrix has to be positive semi-definitive (PSD).</p>

<p align="left">We propose a robust <b>kernel metric learning</b> (RKML) algorithm based on the regression technique. We provide the theoretical guarantee, i.e., statistical error bounds, and verify its efficiency and effectiveness for image annotation on flickr 1M dataset by comparing it to both state-of-the-art distance metric learning and image annotation approaches. The framework of RKML can be referred by click <a href="images/rkml.png">here</a>.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Do not suffer from information loss by directly utilizing image annotations (effectiveness). </li>
  <li>Alleviate the overfitting risk via a Low rank regularizer (effectiveness, efficiency). </li>
  <li>PSD property is automatically ensured by regression (efficiency).</li>
  <li>Kernel matrix is approximated by Nystrom method rather than fully computed (efficiency).</li>
  <li>Precision was improved by 5% compared with state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms (LMNN, ITML, etc.). </li>
